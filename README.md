# LuxSpeed — Internet Speed Test

A simple and elegant web-based internet speed test built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to quickly assess their internet connection's download and upload speeds directly from their browser.

## Features

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive design for easy navigation.
*   **Real-time Speed Measurement:** Provides real-time feedback on download and upload speeds.
*   **Visual Representation:**  Uses a canvas element to visually represent the speed test progress.
*   **Download Speed Test:** Measures the rate at which data can be downloaded.
*   **Upload Speed Test:** Measures the rate at which data can be uploaded.
*   **Reset Functionality:** Allows users to easily restart the test.
*   **Informative Results:** Displays key metrics such as download speed, upload speed, and latency.

## Requirements

*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
*   Internet connection

## Installation

No installation is required.  LuxSpeed is designed to run directly in a web browser.  Simply download the project files (index.html, potentially any JavaScript files), and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Click the "Start" button to begin the speed test.
3.  Observe the visual representation and the displayed metrics during the test.
4.  Once the test is complete, the results will be displayed.
5.  Click the "Reset" button to run the test again.

## File Structure

```
Internet-Speed-Tester/
├── index.html    # Main HTML file containing the structure and styling.
└── [other files] # If any js or other files are present
```

## Testing

Due to the nature of this project relying on network conditions, automated testing is complex. Manual testing is recommended:

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2.  Run the speed test multiple times at different times of the day.
3.  Compare the results with other speed test tools or your ISP's advertised speeds to ensure accuracy.
4.  Test on different devices and network connections to identify any inconsistencies.

## Configuration

There are currently no configurable options exposed in the HTML or JS files.  The test duration, file sizes used for testing, and other parameters are hardcoded. Future improvements will allow configuring these settings.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  If you'd like to contribute to LuxSpeed, please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.
4.  Submit a pull request.

## Improvements

*   **Configuration Options:** Allow users to configure test parameters such as duration, file sizes, and server selection.
*   **Server Selection:** Implement server selection for more accurate results based on proximity.
*   **Historical Data:** Store and display historical test results.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Improve the user interface for mobile devices.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implement automated testing to ensure reliability.
*   **Detailed Statistics:** Provide more detailed statistics about the connection, such as jitter and packet loss.
*   **Progress Bar:** Include a visual progress bar to represent the percentage of the test completed.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and display any errors during the test.
